# Resume_Screening

Hiring the right talent is a challenge for all businesses. This challenge is magnified by the high volume of applicants if the business is labour-intensive, growing, and facing high attrition rates.

This task of selecting the best talent among many others is known as Resume Screening.

Typically, large companies do not have enough time to open each CV, so they use machine learning algorithms for the Resume Screening task.

● SKLEARN

● RE

● NLTK

● Wordcloud

--> We divide the dataset into different categories via bar graph and then visualise them through pie chart to understand the distributuion of each category

--> We later see the content via WordCloud for simplicity

--> For taining the dataset I have used one vs the rest classifier and KNeighborsClassifier.
